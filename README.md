# Lincase-chrome extension

Lincase is a chrome extension which allows its users to save  
links and make them accessible for later usage.

hmmm... a useful tool for procrastinators like me

it is a very basic extension which consists only 3 buttons

1. save input ->  we can manually enter or copy paste links
2. save tab  -> just with a click the extension saves the current tab you are  in right now
3. Delete all -> double click this button to delete all the saved links
